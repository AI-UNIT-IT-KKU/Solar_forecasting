##  Overview

This project presents a **machine learningâ€“based solar power forecasting system** trained on real solar panel sensor data collected over a full year with minute-level resolution.  
The system predicts **active power output (W)** based on irradiance, temperature, and environmental features.  
Two models were developed and compared:
- **LightGBM Forecasting Model (15-minute aggregation)**
- **XGBoost Predictive Model (1-hour aggregation)**

The **15-minute LightGBM** model achieved higher accuracy and better short-term forecasting stability.

---

##  Objectives
- Predict **real-time solar power output** with high accuracy.  
- Handle **seasonal and non-linear variations** in irradiance and temperature.  
- Deploy a **Flask web app** for real-time prediction and visualization.  
- Compare forecasting intervals (hourly vs. 15-min).  
- Provide clear visual analysis and system explainability.

| Model Type | Algorithm | Interval | Target | RÂ² (Test) | RMSE (W) |
|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|------------|------------|
| Forecasting | LightGBM | 15 min | Active Power | 0.996 | 6,450 |
| Predictive | XGBoost | 1 hour | Active Power | 0.993 | 8,034 |

##  Features Used

| Category | Feature | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Irradiance** | `avg_poa_combined`, `avg_ghi_w_m2` | Plane-of-array and global horizontal irradiance |
| **Temperature** | `avg_moduletemp_combined`, `avg_ambienttemp_c` | Module & ambient temperature |
| **Humidity** | `avg_humidity_pct` | Air humidity percentage |
| **Temporal** | `hour`, `day_of_year`, `month` | Time indicators |
| **Cyclical Encoding** | `sin_hour`, `cos_hour`, `sin_day`, `cos_day` | Smooth encoding of time cycles |
| **Autoregressive** | `lag_1`, `lag_2`, `lag_4`, `lag_8`, `lag_16` | Historical lagged active power |
| **Rolling Stats** | `roll_mean_4`, `roll_std_4` | Local mean and variation in recent intervals |

##  Hyperparameters (Optimized via GridSearchCV)

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| `learning_rate` | 0.05 |
| `num_leaves` | 63 |
| `max_depth` | 8 |
| `min_child_samples` | 20 |
| `n_estimators` | 300 |
| `subsample` | 0.9 |
| `colsample_bytree` | 0.9 |
| `random_state` | 42 |

**Validation Strategy:**  
TimeSeriesSplit with `n_splits=5` to ensure temporal consistency.

##  Mathematical Representation

Cyclical encoding ensures smooth time transitions:
\[
\sin_{hour} = \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi \times hour}{24}\right), \quad
\cos_{hour} = \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi \times hour}{24}\right)
\]

\[
\sin_{day} = \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi \times day\_of\_year}{365}\right), \quad
\cos_{day} = \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi \times day\_of\_year}{365}\right)
\]

##  Flask Web Deployment

A **Flask-based interactive web app** allows users to:
- Input real solar data manually or use automatic time detection.
- Generate instant predictions from the trained model.
- Automatically reset the page after refresh for a clean interface.
